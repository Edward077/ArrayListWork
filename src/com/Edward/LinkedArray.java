        //In the previous chapter, you learned about the ArrayList class.
        // The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList:
        LinkedList<String> cars =new LinkedList<>();
        cars.add("Benze");
        cars.add("Honda");
        cars.add("Benze 190");
        cars.add("Benze 280");
        System.out.println(cars);
        System.out.println(cars.getLast()); 9// application of methods


                         // Note: ArrayList vs. LinkedList

        //The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type,
        // just like the ArrayList.
        //
        //The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class
        // because they both implement the List interface.
        // This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.
        //
        //However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way,
        // they are built very differently.


                    // How the ArrayList works
        //The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it.
        // When an element is added, it is placed into the array.
        // If the array is not big enough, a new,
        // larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.


                    // How the LinkedList works
        //The LinkedList stores its items in "containers."
        // The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list.
        // To add an element to the list,
        // the element is placed into a new container and
        // that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.



                       // When To Use
        //It is best to use an ArrayList when:
        //You want to access random items frequently
        //You only need to add or remove elements at the end of the list



//        It is best to use a LinkedList when:
//        You only use the list by looping through it instead of accessing random items
//        You frequently need to add and remove items from the beginning, middle or end of the
//        list


        // LinkedList provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently:
        //addFirst()	Adds an item to the beginning of the list.
        //addLast()	Add an item to the end of the list
        //removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.
        //removeLast()	Remove an item from the end of the list
        //getFirst()	Get the item at the beginning of the list
        //getLast()	Get the item at the end of the list
